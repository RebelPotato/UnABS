        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          This page is a playground for the
          <a href="http://www.madore.org/~david/programs/unlambda/">Unlambda</a>
          programming language, the original obfuscated and functional (i.e.
          esoteric) programming language based on
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic#Combinatory_calculi"

        <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
        <p>
          The left panel is for entering your program. You can save your program
          using the
          <button
            x-data="{disabled: true}"
            @click="save(); disabled = true"
            :disabled="disabled"
            x-init="$watch('program', str => disabled = str == localStorage.getItem(`unabs`))"
          >
            Save
          </button>
          button (should be disabled if you've saved it) or load an existing
          program using the program selector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if you're feeling particularly lazy, press
          <button @click="genTerm">RAND</button> repeatedly until you get a
          program you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, press
          <button @click="load">
            <strong>Load</strong>
          </button>
          to load your program into the machine and press
          <button @click="step">▶️</button>
          to step through the execution. If you skipped over a state you want to
          inspect, just load your program and step to that state again. Not for
          the faint-hearted!

        <h2>What are these glyphs in my program?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlambda is a functional programming language. By this, I mean that
          <span class="bg-yellow">every value in Unlambda is a function</span>.
          Therefore, the only operation is apply
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`</code>, which applies a
          function to its argument. Also each function has only one argument,
          and we represent a multiple argument function by "currying". (You'll
          understand when you see it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The simplest function is
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">i</code> for identity. The
          identity function just returns its argument verbatim. We can express
          its meaning as:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">`iX = X</code></pre>
        <p>
          Of course, allowing you to express a function as such would make
          programming a breeze. But we unlambda programmers value composition
          over inheritance, and allowing one function to influence another
          function's meaning is too fragile! That's why Unlambda defines it as a
          "built-in" function, and we define any other function in terms of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, we need to throw away values or create values to do
          anything useful (so to speak). To do this, we introduce
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">k</code> and
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">s</code>, where:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">``kXY = X</code></pre>
        <p>and:</p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">```sXYZ = ``XZ`YZ</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notably, our language is already
          <span class="bg-yellow">Turing complete</span>. In fact, we can
          translate any lambda calculus expression into Unlambda! We shall see
          how to do this in a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now Unlambda is nothing but a glorified hand warmer. To actually
          have (read: unleash) an effect on the world, Unlambda provides
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">r</code> and
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">.&lt;char&gt;</code> which acts
          as an identity function, but prints a newline("\n") or a character to
          an output stream.
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">`rX = X</code> (after printing "\n")</pre>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">`.&lt;char&gt;X = X</code> (after printing "&lt;char&gt;")</pre>
        <p>
          For extra confusion, Unlambda also has a couple more combinators
          (<code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">d,c,v</code>) that are a tad
          more complicated and we will cover them later.
        </p>

        <h2>And what's with the State/Term/Value/Walue/Kont?</h2>
        <p>
          This playground is a revolution in Unlambda technology. A program
          stepper in the browser!
        </p>
        <p>
          This works by transforming the Unlambda evaluator into an abstract
          machine (to be described in another article) and implementing it in
          javascript (and also in rust). An abstract machine is basically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a way to transform a program into a "state"</li>
          <li>and a function turning one state into another</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Executing a program is then just a matter of transforming the program,
          stepping through the states until we cannot go any further, and
          finally extracting the return value from the final state.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this machine, each state has a clear meaning. There are four kinds
          of states in total, and every one of them has one or many "thing"s
          (terms or values) and a <strong>Continuation</strong> (<strong
            >Kont</strong
          >
          for short). This value represents
          <span class="bg-yellow">the remaining computation</span> to be done
          after evaluating the current "thing"s to a value. It is represented by
          a program with a hole (), where the value returned from the current
          state is to be inserted. It can also contain unevaluated terms, which
          are wrapped by a pair of square brackets []. For example:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">``s``s`ks()[i]</code></pre>
        <p>
          This continuation means that: after the current value resolves (for
          example to <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">k</code>), evaluate
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">i</code> (the continuation will
          be <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">``s``s`ksk()</code> when
          this happens), plug it back in, and return it (<code
            class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2"
            >``s``s`kski</code
          >) as the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every computation has a continuation, the stepper just makes it
          explicit.
        </p>
        <p>Okay, so here are the four states of this machine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-dark-green light-yellow ph1">Eval(Term)</strong>
            evaluates a term and returns its value.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-dark-green light-yellow ph1"
              >ApplyT(Value, Term)</strong
            >
            applies a value to a term and returns the result. (Spoiler: we need
            this step because of the
            <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">d</code> operator)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-dark-green light-yellow ph1"
              >ApplyV(Value, Walue)</strong
            >
            applies a value to a walue
            <span class="f6">(I know, I'm bad at naming)</span> and returns the
            result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="bg-dark-green light-yellow ph1"
              >ApplyK(Value)</strong
            >
            stuffs a value into the current continuation, and decides what to
            evaluate next.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Listing out the transformation rules is as tedious as writing the code
          for the machine itself, so for exactly how these states transform
          between each other, just go read the source code. (I may describe them
          in more detail the "deriving the abstract machine" article.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily you don't need to understand this to understand Unlambda. The
          meaning of a program can be understood by rewrite rules, and the
          machine is just a way of executing the program. But understanding the
          machine does make debugging a bit easier.

        <h2>Surely you can't write anything meaningful with this...</h2>
        <p>
          Now back to the language. Is a language without variables pointless
          (point-free, ha)? Definitely not. We can always program in another
          imaginary language and compile that program to Unlambda.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out that
          <strong>combinatory logic is Turing complete</strong>, in the sense
          that every lambda expression can be translated into combinatory logic
          expressions using simple rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The central idea is recursion. Suppose you have a lambda term
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">\x.(body)</code>. If (body)
          does not contain the variable x, this is trivially equivalent to
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`k(body)</code>. If (body) is
          the variable x, then it is equivalent to
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">\x.x = i</code>. If neither of
          these conditions hold, then this term must be of the form
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">\x.(`ab)</code>, which we can
          then transform into
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">``s(\x.a)(\x.b)</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the function
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">\x.`kx</code> can be
          transformed in this way:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">\x.`kx
=> ``s(\x.k)(\x.x)
=> ``s`kki</code></pre>
        <p>
          It is nothing short of a miracle that this works! Definitely
          inefficient though, for we could have written
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">k</code> directly. This also
          leads to an interesting observation: for every term, turning it into
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">\x.`(term)x</code> and then
          expanding it will give you another term with the same meaning, but
          longer. Exponentially longer (for the number of expansions), in fact!
        </p>
        <p>
          And now with the power of the lambda calculus at our disposal, we can
          go wild! Represent integers! Booleans! Lists! Recursions! The
          possibilities are (quite literally) boundless. See wikipedia
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding"
            >Church encoding</a
          >
          for more ideas.

        <h2>
          Wait you only talked about
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`ski</code>, what about the
          others?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let's go over
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">dcv</code> quickly. Starting
          with the easiest:
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">v</code> consumes every value
          applied to it,
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2">`vx = v</code></pre>
        <p>
          Remember the <strong>Continuation</strong> (<strong>Kont</strong>
          for short)?
          <span class="bg-yellow">The remaining computation</span>? You may have
          noticed that a continuation looks a bit like a function: it has
          <strong>a hole</strong> where you can plug in a value, just like a
          lambda expression with one variable. Well guess what, you can make a
          function out of it!
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">c</code> stands for call/cc in
          scheme, a function that takes a lambda expression and calls it with
          the current continuation ("reified" as / polymorphed into a function)
          passed to it, hence the name. Passing a value to the current
          continuation will restore the remaining computation to that
          continuation, but with this value as the current value. Basically
          <strong>time travel</strong>.
        </p>
        <pre
          class="tc"
        ><code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2 tc">`cx[K] = `xK[K]</code> and
<code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph2 tc">`Kx[K'] = x[K]</code></pre>
        <p>
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">c</code> is notorious hard to
          understand and even harder to use, which is why this playground added
          a helpful Kont panel to show you what the continuation is at any point
          in time. For some serious usage of
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">c</code> / brain-melting fun,
          see <span class="courier">count2.unl</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We mentioned Unlambda being a Strict language, where every value is
          evaluated before being passed to another function. This means that
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`k`ri</code> will print a
          newline before returning
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`kr</code>. But a special form
          (read: not a function but used like one to maximize confusion)
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">d</code> can be used to suspend
          evaluation of a value, resuming it when the compound expression is
          applied again. For example,
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`d`ri</code> will not print
          anything, and return the value
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`d`ri</code>, where
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">`ri</code> is untouched. Only
          by calling this value again, say
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">``d`rik</code>, will a newline
          be printed and a value returned, in this case
          <code class="bg-lightest-blue br2 ph1">k &lt;= `rk &lt;= ``rik</code>.
